  <h2>All about me!</h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm Meredith! I created this webpage to practice my HTML skills. Here are a few things I enjoy doing in my spare time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reading</li>
    <li>playing <a href="http://www.shrapnelgames.com/Camo_Workshop/MBT/MBT_page.html">WinSPMBT</a></li>
    <li>building <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> decks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've been reading a lot of books lately. Here are a few I've really enjoyed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Clear and Present Danger</em> by Tom Clancy</li>
    <li><em>Blood Rites</em>, a <strong>Dresden Files</strong> novel by Jim Butcher</li>
    <li><em>Down The River</em> by Edward Abbey</li>
  </ol>
